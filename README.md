Generative Adversarial Networks are used heavily for generating synthetic data and for upsampling an unbalanced dataset. However, it has more to it and one of it's application can be observed in this repository. Text-to-Image Metamorphosis is translation of a text to an Image. Essentially, it is inverse of Image Captioning. In Image Captioning, given an image, we develop a model to generate a caption for it based on the underlying scene. Text-to-Image Metamorphosis, generates an image from a corresponding text by understanding the language semantics. Various works have been done in this domain, the most notable being developing an Attentional GAN model to develop images given a local word feature vector and a global sentence vector. Currently we have only worked on AttnGAN. Further up, we intend to implement [MirrorGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05854), an extension of AttnGAN to generate images from sentences and reconstruct the sentences from the generated image, so as to see how similar are the input and output sentences. Concretely, we would like a input and output sentences to be as close to each other (like a mirror) so as to conclude, the underlying generation is close to ground truth.

## Dependencies &nbsp;

You can either create a virtualenv or a docker container for running the project. We went about creating a virtualenv <br>
Necessary libraries include but not limited to the following and are installed using pip.

python==3.6.5 <br>
numpy=>=1.18.1 <br>
pandas>=1.0.1 <br>
nltk>=3.4.5 <br>
torch>=1.4.0 <br>
torchvision>=0.5.0 <br>

## System Information &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-18.04-blueviolet)

Developed and configured this project on MAC using PyCharm IDE and trained the model on Google Cloud using NVidia Tesla T4 GPUs <br>

The data lies in the data directory. A download the bird.zip file and place it in the data directory in this repository. Following are the files in the bird.zip file.

/birds/CUB_200_2011/ : It contains an images directory which holds 200 bird class directories. The bird dataset has 200 classes of birds each class has ~60 images of birds.
/birds/CUB_200_2011/bounding_boxes.txt : file which contains bounding box information of the birds in the true images. The annotations are in [top-left-x, top-left-y, width, height] format.
/birds/CUB_200_2011/classes.txt : file containing names of all the 200 classes.
/birds/CUB_200_2011/image_class_labels.txt : file containing class labels. First 60 lines belong to image 1, next 60 lines belong to image 2 and so and so forth.
/birds/CUB_200_2011/images.txt : file containing all the image names in the dataset. this is about ~12000 images, 60 images per class.

## How to run?

1. Run build.sh to build docker image.
2. Run run.sh to start docker container. Make sure to enable X11 forwarding between docker and host machine. Run xhost local:docker prior to running the container.
3. Check if inside /app directory. Inside /app directory, execute run.sh and enter the image and IUV map image names for generating 3D Â models. An obj file and pickle file is saved in the output directory.

## Results

We used the following 3 custom statements for generating images and got some appreciable results for the same.

1. a bird is blue with black and has a long beak.
2. a red bird has a white belly and short beak.
3. a bird has long white wings.
