This project is used to generate 3D model of an image consisting of a person, provided the IUV maps and an input image is provided. The input image needs to be of 1024x1024 dimension. For more information click on the GitHub shiled above. For the concepts involved in this project refer click on the arXiv shield above.

## Dependencies &nbsp;
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-yellowgreen) &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-pip-orange)

You can either create a virtualenv or a docker container for running the project. <br>
Necessary libraries include the following and are installed using pip.

python>=2.7.0 <br>
numpy>=1.16.0 <br>
scipy>=1.2.0 <br>
chumpy>=0.65 <br>
keras>=2.2.0 <br>
tensorflow==2.0.2 <br>
tensorboard==2.0.0 <br>

For an entire list of libraries refer the [requirements.txt](http://gitlab.uiius.com/uvision/texture3d/blob/master/requirements.txt) file. <br>
For Docker setup refer Docker section below.

## System Information &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-18.04-blueviolet)

Developed and configured this project along with Docker containerization on Ubuntu 18.04.
Data lies in the following path:

/mnt/data/texture3D/images/ : directory containing images each of 1024x1024 dimension. &nbsp;
/mnt/data/texture3D/iuvs/ : directory containing IUV map of each person in an image. If image contains multiple persons, multiple images exist. For ex: If an image named test12.png containing multiple persons exists in /images directory, then IUV maps of names iuv12_0.png, iuv_1.png, etc are generated here. &nbsp;
/mnt/data/texture3D/output/ : directory where the .obj and pickle files are exported. &nbsp;


## Docker setup

The entire project is run inside a docker container named <b>tex</b>. The [docker](http://gitlab.uiius.com/uvision/texture3d/tree/master/docker) directory in the project has the [Dockerfile](http://gitlab.uiius.com/uvision/texture3d/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) as well as scripts to [build](http://gitlab.uiius.com/uvision/texture3d/blob/master/docker/build.sh) a docker image and [run](http://gitlab.uiius.com/uvision/texture3d/blob/master/docker/run.sh) a docker container.

#### Building docker image 

The docker image is built using command:

```bash
docker build -t tex2shape:latest .

```

In the above command, <b>tex2shape</b> is name of the docker image while <b>latest</b> is the tag assigned to the image. We use the <b>-t</b> command line argument for The image can be of any name of user interest and the tags essentially distinguish each image from other (e.g. v1.0, v2.0 or latest as in the above case). The period at the end indicates to take the Dockerfile existing in the current directory.

Type,

```bash
docker images
``` 
to find the image which was just built.

#### Running a docker container 

To run a docker container use command:

```bash
docker run --gpus '"device=0"' --name tex --rm --privileged -v /mnt/interns/nikunj/data/texture3D/:/mnt/data -v /home/nikunj/texture3D:/app -p 5000:5000 -e="DISPLAY" -v="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" --net host -it tex2shape:latest bash
```

In above command, the data directory from <b>/mnt/interns/nikunj/data/texture3D/</b> on our local computer to <b>/mnt/data</b> directory inside the docker container. Likewise, we map our code directory from <b>/home/nikunj/texture3D</b> on our local machine to <b>/app</b> directory inside the docker. The above built image tex2shape:latest is used to launch the docker containter using interactive mode (specified by the -it option). <b>tex</b> is name of docker container and this docker is run on a gpu. The GPUs needs to be mentioned with their id's (0 in our case). Use <b>nvidia-smi</b> to get the GPU id.

## How to run?

1. Run build.sh to build docker image.
2. Run run.sh to start docker container. Make sure to enable X11 forwarding between docker and host machine. Run xhost local:docker prior to running the container.
3. Check if inside /app directory. Inside /app directory, execute run.sh and enter the image and IUV map image names for generating 3D Â models. An obj file and pickle file is saved in the output directory.
